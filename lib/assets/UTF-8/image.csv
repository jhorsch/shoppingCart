The stadium is known for its view of 'Touchdown Jesus', a nickname given to the large mural by Millard Sheets of the resurrected Jesus entitled 'The Word of Life', located on Hesburgh Library, which looms over the stadium mirroring the raised arms of a referee signifying a touchdown.

Getting up there wasn't much of a challenge because  building security wasn't a major concern at the time.    It  was now 2007, a few years after 9/11, and security was being heavily  enforced.  I had attempted many times to get back up to the rooftop in  order to capture the Trump Tower building along with other newly built  skyscrapers.  I contacted management of the McCormick building and tried  some other networking channels for the building, but everyone kept  saying the same thing.    'Nobody gets on the roof after 9/11'    I  refused to believe this, so I told a brother-in-law of mine about my  dilemma.  He mentioned that he knew someone in parking security at  Soldier Field and maybe this contact could help me out.  I called the  man right away and luck was on my side.  He asked, 'When do you want to  get up on the roof''?  I answered, 'How about tonight?  He said 'No  problem' so I ended the phone call and jumped in my car.      That  day the weather conditions were ideal for a fall day and the boats  would soon start leaving the harbors in early October.  If I waited  another week, I would lose out on the great scenery and rainfall was in  the weekly forecast.  To capture the photo I had envisioned, timing was  essential.     As  I raced downtown to meet him I couldn't help but think about the  possibility of something going wrong.  However once I arrived, he  brought me straight to the rooftop without any hassle.  He opened to the  door to the roof and once again I was in awe of the spectacular view.   The setting was incredible and I got the shot I wanted after about 10  years of waiting.
